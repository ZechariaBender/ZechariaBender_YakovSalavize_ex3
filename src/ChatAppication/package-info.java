/**
 * <h2>A simple and lightweight chat Java web application</h2>
 * We created a virtual space for chats, conversations, meetings and forums.
 * <br>An arbitrary amount of users can log on to the shared chatroom
 * simply by entering their name.
 * <br>Does not use a database - as all messages and users are stored
 * on the server and are bound to its lifetime.
 * <br><br>Developed by <strong>Zecharia Bender</strong>
 * and <strong>Yakov Salavize</strong> on May 29 2019
 * <br>in the context of exercise 3 of the
 * <i>Web Programming with Java</i> course.
