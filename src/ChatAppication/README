    A simple and lightweight chat Java web application
    We created a virtual space for chats, conversations,
    meetings and forums.
    An arbitrary amount of users can log on to the shared
    chatroom simply by entering their name.
    Does not use a database - as all messages and users
    are stored on the server and are bound to its lifetime.
    Developed in the context of exercise 3 of the
    Web Programming with Java course.
